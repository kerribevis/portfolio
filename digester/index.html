<h1>About Anaerobic Digesters</h1>

<h2>Anaerobic Digestion Explained</h2>

<p>Anaerobic digestion is the process where bacteria consume organic matter in an environment where there is a lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>The by-product of this reaction is biogas. The biogas contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>methane (50% to 75%)</li>
  <li>carbon dioxide</li>
  <li>hydrogen sulfide</li>
  <li>water vapor</li>
  <li>small amounts of other gases</li>
</ul>

<p>Biogas can be used as an alternative energy source, and when treated can be used even as a fuel source.</p>

<p>Another by-product of the anaerobic digestion process is digestate.</p>

<p>Digestate often consists of both solids and liquids. These can be treated and used as:</p>

<ul>
 <li>fertilizers</li>
 <li>animal bedding</li>
 <li>compost</li>
 <li>soil ammendment</li>
</ul>

<p>The anaerobic digestion of manure is an environmentally responsible way of disposing of animal manure. It ensures that harmful pathogens are not released into the soil and nearby water bodies,
   and it helps to create a sustainable farming system.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion</h2>

<p>The anaerobic digestion process breaks down the manure as the bacteria consume the solid waste. This process makes valuable
  nutrients and minerals present in the manure more easily accessble to plants and crops.</p>

<p>The process of anaerobic digestion helps to remove pathogens from the manure, improving not just livestock and crop health
  but the water quality of surrounding bodies of water.</p>

<p>The biogas that is produced as a by-product of anaerobic digestion can be used as an alternative energy source.</p>

<p>Anaerobic digesters can help reduce the amount of greenhouses gases produced by farms.</p>

<h2>Available Models</h2>

<p>Moore's specializes in designing and building two kinds of anaerobic digesters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plug Flow Digesters</li>
  <li>Complete Mix Digesters</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plug Flow Digesters</h3>

<!-- https://www.epa.gov/agstar/anaerobic-system-design-and-technology -->

<ul>
  <li>Plug flow digesters consist of a long, narrow vessel.</li>
  <li>This vessel is heated and insulated.</li>
  <li>The vessel is partially buried.</li>
  <li>The vessel is made from either fiberglass, steel or reinforced concrete.</li>
  <li>A tight cover, which can be rigid or flexible, is used to capture the produced biogas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complete Mix Digesters</h3>

<img src="mixing.gif" alt="A simple diagram of a complete mix digester">

<ul>
  <li>Complete mix digesters are similar to plug flow digesters in that the vessel is heated, but complete mix digesters are fitted with mixing systems.</li>
  <li>The mixing systems are either mechanical, hydraulic or gas.</li>
  <li>Complete mix digesters have either a rigid or flexible cover.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Processes</h2>

<h3>Plug Flow Digester</h3>

<p>The plug flow digester works best when the percentage of solids in the manure is around 15%. If there are not enough solids in the manure, more organic waste may need to be added.</p>

<p>We normally recommend this digester for farms that collect manure via scraping.</p>

<h4>Plug Flow Digester Process</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Manure flows into the digester vessel</li>
  <li>As material flows in, material already in the vessel is displaced and moves out</li>
  <li>The percentage of solids means that the material moves through the vessel as a plug, not settling</li>
  <li>Retention time in the digester is recommended around 15 to 20 days</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complete Mix Digester</h3>

<p>The complete mix digester works best when the percentage of solids in the manure is around 3% to 6%.</p>

<p>The complete mix digester is most suitable for farms where manure is diluted with some kind of waste water (such as on dairy farms).</p>

<h4>Complete Mix Digester Process</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Manure flows into the digester vessel</li>
  <li>As material flows in, material already in the vessel is displaced and moves out</li>
  <li>The mixing system can eithe be used continuously or only used for certain timed periods</li>
  <li>Retention time in the digester is recommended around 20 to 30 days</li>
