<h1>Workshop Safety</h1>

<h2>Module 2: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>

<div class="intro">

<p>Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE for short, is the equipment that staff and students in the workshop wear to keep themselves safe. PPE is mandatory and must be worn at all times when in the workshop or on the workshop grounds.</p>

<h3>Why PPE is worn</h3>

<p>PPE is worn to protect people in the workshop or on the workshop grounds from potential hazards or accidents. Some of the equipment used in workshops is loud, produces air pollutants and can cause injuries if used incorrectly.
  PPE is used to make sure that people are protected when working with or around this equipment. Workshops can also contain hazardous chemicals that can be toxic if inhaled or can cause chemical burns if touched.
  PPE also offers potection against these chemicals.</p>

<p>Accidents can happen in the workshop. PPE is worn to protect people from potential accidents such as chemical spills, fires, ventilation breakdowns and machine malfunctions.</p>

<h3>When to wear PPE</h3>

<p>As soon as someone enters the grounds of the workshop, they should be wearing their PPE. No one will be permitted onto the workshop grounds or into the workshop without wearing the appropriate PPE.</p>

<p>PPE should never be removed inside the workshop unless under the guidance of a supervising manager or medical professional. If you need to remove your PPE for some reason, exit the workshop and the workshop grounds
  before removing any of the PPE.</p>

<p>Removal of PPE without reason inside the workshop or on the workshop grounds will result in an automatic failure of the module.</p>

<h3>Types of PPE</h3>

<h4>Helmets/Hardhats</h4>

<p>Helmets/hardhats protect the skull, face and neck from injuries.</p>

<h4>Safety glasses</h4>

<p>Safety glasses, or sometimes called safety goggles, protect the eyes and surrounding ocular tissue from injuries, as well as from harsh chemicals and irritants.
  If any welding is done, students are required to wear welding goggles or a face shield to protect them from the infrared radiation.</p>

<h4>Earplugs</h4>

<p>Earplugs protect the eardrum from loud noise produced by some machines. Ear muffs can also be worn.</p>

<h4>Mask</h4>

<p>Dust masks protect the lungs from fine dust, as well as other fine particles. When inhaled, these can cause sickness as well as damage the lining of the lungs and throat.
Dust masks must be well fitting and must closely adhere to the face.</p>

<h4>Safety shoes</h4>

<p>Safety shoes protect the toes, feet and ankles from injuries. Safety shoes contain steel tips that protect feet from falling objects. Safety shoes also contain a special insulated sole. We recommend students wear thick socks as safety shoes can sometimes cause blisters and chaffing.</p>

<h4>High-visibility jacket</h4>

<p>High-visibility jackets ensure that everyone is easily seen when in the workshop and on the workshop grounds. This can help prevent accidents. High-visibility clothing can also ensure that if there is an accident
   the injured person can be easily identified by supervising managers and medical professionals.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 3vh;">More about this project:</p>
  <p style="font-size: 3vh;">This sample is intended to be part of a workshop safety module for university engineering students. These students need to complete a workshop module
                             as part of their undergraduate engineering degree. This module is common to all first-year engineering students. It is eight-weeks long. They have to complete
                             a workshop readiness course before they are allowed to start the workshop training.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 3vh;">The entire course is done online and is self-paced. There are small quizzes at the end to
                             track students' progress. They need a minimum of 60% across all quizzes to pass.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 3vh;">Students are required as part of their degree to have access to a computer. They can also use the WiFi on campus if they do not have WiFi at home.
                             To facilitate learning and to avoid connectivity and data issues, the module has been kept basic in its design.
                             The simple design is also easy to navigate for all students.</p>
