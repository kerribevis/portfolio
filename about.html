<h2>Hi, I'm Kerri.<h2>
<p>I am an e-learning developer.</p>

<p>I became interested in education when I was studying my undergraduate degree. I completed modules in language learning
  and language acquisition, and this created in me a fascination with the process of human learning.</p>

<p>I wanted to find out what created a positive learning experience and what could negatively impact one.</p>

<p>I completed a BA in English Studies. I then completed an Honours year in Applied Language Studies. My research essay was an examination of the impact
  of colonial education on students' performance in university level academic literacy.</p>

<p>I worked in the copywriting industry and then moved to the edu-tech industry. This year, I decided to pursue an e-learning development certificate from
  Durham College.</p>

<p>During my HTML and CSS module, I heard the siren song of computer programming. I decided to pause my certificate and pursue a Diploma
   in Computer Programming from Algonquin College. I am currently studying towards that diploma.</p>

<div class="content">

<p>Why computer programming and instructional design?</p>

<p>They may not be the most 'normal' combination but I wanted to be able to create learning experiences from scratch. I didn't want to be held back because I did not understand
   the backend of LMS platforms or websites.</p>

<p>I want to create captivating, beautiful and accessible learning experiences for all learners. To do this, I wanted to be able to understand
   not just the theory of instructional design but the technical side too.</p>
