<button onclick="functionOne()">1: What is Paleontology?</button>
<div id="one" style="display: none;">
  <p>Paleontology is the study of ancient plants and animals.
  These plants and animals often are no longer alive.
  We have to use fossils and other remains to learn about these plants and animals.</p>

<div id="buttontwo">
<button onclick="functionTwo()">2: Where do Paleontologists work?</button>
<div id="two" style="display: none;">
  <p>Paleontologists can work in the field, in laboratories, in museums, at universities and in research facilities.
  Paleontologists who work in the field normally work on what we call 'sites'.
  Sites are where it is egal to dig for the remains of ancient life.</p>

<div id="buttonthree">
  <button onclick="functionThree()">3: What are fossils?</button>
  <div id="three" style="display: none;">
   <p>Fossils are the remains of ancient life.
   Fossils are formed when living material (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria) dies and is preserved, often in rock.
   Fossils are not the actual remains of the living material, but 'imprints' of the material left in the rock.</p>
  </div>

<div id="buttonfour">
  <button onclick="functionFour()">4: Where are fossils mainly found?</button>
  <div id="four" style="display: none;">
    <p>The remains of ancient life are often called fossils.
    Fossils are mainly found in sedimentary rock.
    Sedimentary rock is formed by tiny bits of rock and minerals being compacted together over time.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="buttonfive">
  <button onclick="functionFive()">5: How are fossils formed?</button>
  <div id="five" style="display: none;">
    <p>Fossilization is actually not very common. A very specific set of condtiions need to be met for fossilization to happen.
    For a fossil to form, the living organism needs to be covered in sediment soon after dying.
    Minerals in the sediment will slowly seep into the remains and will fossilize and preserve them.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="buttonsix">
  <button onclick="functionSix()">6: Can anything be a fossil?</button>
  <div id="six" style="display: none;">
    <p>Often, only living organisms with hard bodies or hard parts of their body are fossilized.</p>
